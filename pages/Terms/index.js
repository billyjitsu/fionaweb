      <p className="mb-5 text-sm">
        Welcome to the Terms of Service (these “Terms”) for the website, NFBeez
        (the “Website”), operated by NFBeez DAO (“Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”).
        The Website and any content, tools, features and functionality offered
        on or through our Website are collectively referred to as the
        “Services”. These Terms govern your access to and use of the Services.
        Please read these Terms carefully, as they include important information
        about your legal rights. By accessing and/or using the Services, you are
        agreeing to these Terms. If you do not understand or agree to these
        Terms, please do not use the Services. For purposes of these Terms,
        “you” and “your” means you as the user of the Services. If you use the
        Services on behalf of a company or other lawful entity then “you”
        includes you and that entity, and you represent and warrant that (a) you
        are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to
        bind the entity to these Terms, and (b) you agree to these Terms on the
        entity’s behalf.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5">1. Definitions. </p>
      <p className="mb-5 text-sm">
        “Agreement” as defined in Article 3.1 herein. “Art” means any digital
        creation, art, design and drawings created by its author, and first
        released to the public by the Creator, that may be associated with an
        NFT that can be transferred to an Owner. “Creator” means the entity
        which released to the public the Purchased NFT and related Art, on
        behalf of its author – in this case, the Company. “Effective Date” means
        the date on which the Agreement is attached to the Purchased NFT for the
        first time. “NFT” means any blockchain-tracked, non-fungible token. In
        this case, tokens created by NFBeez. “Own” means, with respect to an
        NFT, an NFT that one has purchased or otherwise rightfully acquired from
        a legitimate source, where proof of such purchase is recorded on the
        relevant blockchain, thus becoming Owner of the Purchased NFT and
        related Art. “Owner” means the current owner of the NFT and related Art.
        In the case of transfer of ownership, including by means of Resale, the
        recipient becomes the sole Owner of the Purchased NFT. There can be
        several different owners of each NFT (and related Art) throughout time
        but only one Owner at a time. Owner shall include Primary Owner and all
        subsequent Owners. “Primary Assignment” means the first assignment by
        Creator of all its rights, title and interest in and to the intellectual
        property rights on the Art to Primary Owner. 2 “Primary Owner” means the
        individual or entity qualifying as Owner on the Effective Date and party
        to the Primary Assignment. “Purchased NFT” means a NFBeez NFT that one
        has purchased, or acquired in any way, and thus Owns altogether with the
        related Art. “Purchase Price” means the price for such NFTs as set forth
        in the applicable listing for the NFT, and all processing fees,
        commission fees, network fees (including gas fees), handling charges,
        and all applicable taxes in connection with your purchase. “Resale”
        means the sale by Owner of the Purchased NFT and related Art to a
        subsequent buyer, which shall Own the Purchased NFT and related Art upon
        its effective purchase and thus become its new Owner. “Secondary
        Assignment” means, in case of Resale, any and all assignment by Owner of
        all its rights, title and interest in and to the intellectual property
        rights in the Art to the subsequent buyer of the Purchased NFT.

        2.5 Purchasing NFTs. You acknowledge and agree that all payment
        information you provide with regards to a purchase of NFTs, is accurate,
        current, and complete. When you purchase NFTs, you agree to pay the
        Purchase Price. All fees and charges are payable in accordance with
        payment terms in effect at the time the fee or the charge becomes
        payable. You agree to be solely responsible for any applicable taxes
        resulting from the purchase or sale of NFTs. In certain cases, your
        transaction may not be successful due to an error with the blockchain
        that is recording the transaction. We accept no responsibility or
        liability to you for any such failed transactions, or any transaction or
        gas fees that may be incurred by you in connection with such failed
        transactions. To the extent you purchase a third party’s NFT via the
        Services, you bear full responsibility for verifying the authenticity,

      <p className="mb-5">3. ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS</p>
      <p className="mb-5 text-sm">
        3.1 Agreement. This Assignment of Rights Agreement (this “Assignment of
        Rights Agreement”) shall govern the terms and conditions of assignment
        of all rights, title and interest in and to the intellectual property
        rights of the Art to which this Assignment of Rights Agreement is
        attached. This Assignment of Rights Agreement shall govern the Primary
        Assignment under which Creator has agreed to assign to Primary Owner its
        intellectual property rights to the Art and all Secondary Assignments
        between Owner and any subsequent buyers or acquirers of the Purchased
        NFT. This Agreement shall remain in force as long as it is still
        attached to the Purchased NFT. By acquiring the Purchased NFT and
        related Art by any means whatsoever, Owner hereby acknowledges having
        read this Agreement and agrees to all of its terms and conditions. This
        Assignment of Rights Agreement shall apply to the Primary Assignment and
        all Secondary Assignments. 4
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5 text-sm">
        3.2 Primary Assignment. In consideration of the Purchase Price and
        subject to Primary Owner’s continued compliance with this Assignment of
        Rights Agreement and applicable laws, Creator hereby assigns as of the
        Effective Date to Primary Owner, on an exclusive basis, for the legal
        duration of the intellectual property rights and for the whole world,
        all exploitation, reproduction, representation and adaptation rights
        relating to the Art attached to the Purchased NFT to which this
        Assignment of Rights Agreement is attached. The rights of reproduction,
        representation and adaptation are granted to Primary Owner for all modes
        of exploitation, including commercial ones, and on all medium and/or
        media (including but not limited to, digital media, physical media,
        paper editions, optical discs, storage media, multimedia, etc.), using
        all formats (including but not limited to, still images, animated
        sequences, etc.) and by all technical processes known to date or to come
        (including but not limited to digitalization and computer storage,
        downloading, all computerized means or electronic communication
        networks, etc.), and such rights shall include, in particular but
        without being limited to it: (i) the reproduction by any process of the
        Art, by any means known and/or unknown in the current state of the Art,
        including but not limited to manufacturing, duplication, copying,
        broadcasting, distribution, publication, marketing, promotion and
        advertising, in all formats and sizes, allowing communication to third
        parties, by any means and/or medium; (ii) the representation and
        communication, directly or indirectly, to third parties, of the Art, in
        whole or in part, by any means of communication known or unknown to
        date, including but not limited to by catalogue, written press, display,
        POS advertising, posters, television and by all public or private, free
        or paying, analogue or digital, telecommunication or computer networks,
        online and offline, including the Internet and any other equivalent;
        (iii) the right to, subject to the Creator’s moral rights set forth in
        Article 3.5, and where technically required, edit, adapt and modify in a
        non-substantial way the Art, for the purposes of its reproduction or
        representation and to create derivative works thereof, which may include
        corrections of size, format, color, enhancement or preservation of
        certain details and any other required correction; (iv) the right to
        integrate all or part of the Art into another work and create derivative
        work thereof, and the right to affix any trademarks, logos and/or text,
        including advertising, subject to the provisions set forth in Articles
        3.5 and 3.6; (v) the right to proceed, in its name and at its expense,
        to any appropriate registration in the countries of its choice, subject
        to compliance with any registered rights of the Creator. Primary Owner
        shall remain free to exploit or not to exploit the rights thus assigned
        under the trademark or name of its choice, subject to compliance with
        this Agreement. Creator agrees that the full price of transfer of the
        above-listed rights is included in the Purchase Price. Without prejudice
        of the moral rights set forth in Article 6, the Creator shall be deemed
        to have transferred all the above-mentioned rights to Primary Owner on
        the Effective Date, in execution of the Primary Assignment.
        Consequently, the Creator may only use the Art with the prior consent of
        Owner.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5 text-sm">
        3.3 Secondary Assignment. Primary Owner and, where applicable, all
        subsequent Owners, shall have the right to Resale the Purchased NFT, and
        related Art, on a marketplace allowing the purchase and sale of NFTs.
        Owner shall use its best efforts to Resale the Purchased NFT on a
        marketplace which (i) cryptographically verifies each NFT Owner’s
        (current and prior) rights to display the Art in order to list it for
        sale, to ensure that only the actual Owner can display the Art for
        Resale, and (ii) provides for a percentage of the Resale price to be
        automatically granted to the Creator upon Resale. Primary Owner and,
        where applicable, all subsequent Owners, shall have 5 the right to
        license, assign or otherwise transfer to a third-party all of the
        intellectual property rights on the Art hereby granted as per this
        Assignment of Rights Agreement, for any purpose whatsoever. In case of
        transfer of ownership of the Purchased NFT, in any way whatsoever,
        including Resale, Owner agrees to assign to the subsequent buyer of the
        Purchased NFT all rights on the related Art set forth in Article 3.2 of
        this Assignment of Rights Agreement, under the same conditions, to the
        extent such rights have not been previously transferred to a third-party
        in compliance with the Assignment of Rights Agreement. In case of
        transfer of ownership of the Purchased NFT, in any way whatsoever,
        including Resale, all rights on the Art granted by Owner to a
        third-party, and/or rights of Owner on derivate works thereof, shall
        remain in force and fully effective after the Resale, unless otherwise
        agreed upon between Owner and the subsequent buyer. This Assignment of
        Rights Agreement shall govern any Resale as long as it is still attached
        to the Purchased NFT and provided no other agreement has been agreed to
        by Owner and the subsequent buyer, which shall only apply between the
        parties of said agreement.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5 text-sm">
        3.4 Compensation. It is expressly agreed that all intellectual property
        rights assigned to Primary Owner, per the Primary Assignment, or to the
        subsequent Owners, per a Secondary Assignment, are granted in
        consideration of the price paid by Owner to purchase the Purchased NFT,
        as listed on the NFT marketplace on which it is acquired (the “Purchase
        Price”), where applicable, which shall be deemed fixed and definitive.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Creator shall also be entitled to
        compensation on any Resale of the Complete Work in accordance with the
        percentage of commission determined by the NFT marketplace on which said
        Resale is completed.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-5 text-sm">
        3.5 Moral Rights. Creator shall have the right to enforce, on behalf of
        the author, all moral rights of the author of the Art, as provided by
        applicable law, which shall remain perpetual, inalienable,
        imprescriptible and absolute. Owner hereby undertakes to abide, and make
        its contractors, including licensees and subsequent buyers, and third
        parties abide by the author’s moral rights in any and all use of the
        Art, and in particular the following rights: (i) right of authorship,
        which shall entitle the Creator to demand and claim at any time that the
        author’s chosen name is mentioned on any mode of publication of the Art;
        and (ii) right to preserve the integrity of the Art, which shall entitle
        Creator to oppose any modification, deletion or addition likely to alter
        the Art, or any use of the Art that may alter its spirit, devaluate it
        or otherwise be deemed prejudicial to the reputation of the author.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5 text-sm">
        3.6 Trademarks. When using the Art, in any way whatsoever, including but
        not limited to its publication, exploitation, and/or promotion, Owner
        shall not use the trademarks, service marks or proprietary words or
        symbols of Creator, to the extent otherwise permitted by applicable law
        or by written agreement of Creator. Creator shall have the right, at its
        sole discretion, to promote, including through social media, any public
        use of the Art by Owner, unless Owner informs the Creator otherwise in
        writing. Except as set forth in this Article 3.6, nothing contained in
        this Agreement shall grant either party any right, title or interest in
        or to the other party’s trademarks. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Owner
        shall not use the Art in a way that would or could present Creator as
        endorsing, recommending or favoring Owner and/or its use of the Art.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5 text-sm">
        3.7 Cooperation. Creator and Owner shall cooperate in good faith and
        reasonably assist each other in the prosecution of legal proceedings
        involving the Art, or derivative works therefrom, 6 including
        proceedings conducted for the purpose of protecting any and all
        intellectual property rights in the Art from infringement. Creator shall
        have the right to protect and defend, including through litigation, the
        rights attached to the Art in the event of Owner’s inaction.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5 text-sm">
        3.8 Amendment. Creator may amend this Assignment of Rights Agreement and
        publish amended versions from time to time. The latest version published
        shall apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amended version of this
        Assignment of Rights Agreement shall have the effect to restrict the
        rights granted to Owner under this version unless agreed to by Owner in
        writing.

        4.4 Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver. In the event that any
        dispute, claim, or controversy relating to this Agreement arises between
        you and the Company, you agree to make a good faith effort to resolve
        the dispute. If the dispute is not resolved following such meeting, and
        either party wishes to pursue the dispute further, that party shall
        commence arbitration by filing an arbitration demand with the American
        Arbitration Association (“AAA”) within twenty (20) days of the meeting.
        The dispute shall be resolved through arbitration to be heard in San
        Juan, Puerto Rico unless the parties agree otherwise. Any dispute
        subject to arbitration under this section shall be settled by binding
        arbitration, except to the extent that the dispute is required by law to
        be resolved by a state or federal regulatory authority. Arbitration
        shall be limited to disputes between the Parties and cannot be
        consolidated or joined with claims of other persons who may have similar
        claims. The Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA shall apply, using a
        single arbitrator, and the Parties must mutually agree on the choice of
        the arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator, the
        arbitrator shall be appointed pursuant the AAA Commercial Arbitration
        Rules. The decision of the arbitrator shall be binding. Each party shall
        bear its own costs (including attorneys’ fees) during the proceedings,
        and all other costs of the arbitration proceeding shall be shared
        equally by the parties, except as may be awarded in the discretion of
        the arbitrator (including the award of attorneys’ fees) in accordance
        with the arbitration decision. Judgment upon the award rendered by the
        arbitrator may be entered and enforced in any court of competent
        jurisdiction. In the event a dispute arising under this Agreement is
        required by law to be resolved by a state or federal regulatory
        authority, the Parties agree to be bound by the findings of such state
        or federal regulatory authority. This arbitration section shall survive
        the termination of the Agreement. Any arbitration under these Terms will
        take place on an individual basis – class arbitrations and class actions
        are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to these Terms, you
        and the Company are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to
        participate in a class action or 11 class arbitration.

        4.5 Updating These Terms. We may modify these Terms from time to time in
        which case we will update the “Last Revised” date at the bottom of these

        4.6 Termination of License. If you breach any of the provisions of these
        Terms, all licenses granted by the Company will terminate automatically.
        All sections which by their nature should survive the termination of
        these Terms shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and
        notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement by the Company or you.

        4.7 Severability. Each Article of this Agreement constitutes a separate
        and distinct undertaking, covenant or provision. In the event that any
        provision of this Agreement shall be 9 determined to be invalid or
        unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed limited by construction in
        scope and effect to the minimum extent necessary to render the same
        valid and enforceable, and, in the event such a limiting construction is
        impossible, such invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed
        severed from this Agreement, but every other provision of this Agreement
        shall remain in full force and effect.

        4.8 Waiver. All waivers under this Agreement must be made in writing,
        and failure at any time to require the other party’s performance of any
        obligation under this Agreement shall not affect the right subsequently
        to require performance of the obligation.

        4.9 Governing Law. The validity, interpretation and performance of this
        Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto
        Rico without giving effect to the principles of comity or conflicts of
        laws thereof. Each party hereto agrees to submit to the personal
        jurisdiction and venue of the state courts having jurisdiction over the
        Municipality of San Juan, Puerto Rico for a resolution of all disputes
        arising in connection with the interpretation, construction, and
        enforcement of this Agreement, and hereby waives the claim or defense
        therein that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.
