          of the NFT and related Art. In the case of transfer of ownership,
          including by means of Resale, the recipient becomes the sole Owner of

          Assignment. “Purchased NFT” means a NFBeez NFT that one has purchased,

          applicable listing for the NFT, and all processing fees, commission
          fees, network fees (including gas fees), handling charges, and all

          sale by Owner of the Purchased NFT and related Art to a subsequent
          buyer, which shall Own the Purchased NFT and related Art upon its
          effective purchase and thus become its new Owner. “Secondary
          Assignment” means, in case of Resale, any and all assignment by Owner
          of all its rights, title and interest in and to the intellectual
          property rights in the Art to the subsequent buyer of the Purchased

          choose, provided that any purchase of a resold NFT (the “Secondary
          Sale”) will also be subject to this Agreement and any applicable
          Additional Terms. Immediately following any Secondary Sale, your
          ownership of the NFT and rights under any associated licenses will
          terminate. Your purchase of, and the transfer of ownership of, that
          certain NFT is subject to your agreeing to this Agreement, any

          Marketplace, the associated license shall be transferred to that new
          owner, and you will have no further rights in or to the NFT or NFT IP

          immediately expire with respect to that NFT without the requirement of
